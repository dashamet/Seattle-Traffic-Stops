# Traffic Stops in Seattle, Washington

* `seattle.Rmd` contains my code for a dynamic map of the arrests of black and white people in Seattle, Washington from 2006-2009. It produces the HTML file `seattle.html`.

* I used data from the [Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/).
